# Super Isa 

## Basice Run and Jump Platform Game

*An otherworldy adventure starring Super Isa*

**5 Basic Conceptual Components  (in no particular order--yet**

- A moving platform that steadly increases speed (max speed?)
- A background steadily moving at slower speed (parallax--R&D time yay!)
- A sprite--our one and only, Super Isa
- Other sprites--enemies/obstacles to jump over (or maybe blast with laser)
- A Score/info window somewhere at the top of the screen.
