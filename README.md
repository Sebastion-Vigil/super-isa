# Super Isa 

## Basic Run and Jump Platform Game

*An otherworldy adventure starring Super Isa*

### 5 Basic Conceptual Components in no particular order--yet:

- A steadily-moving platform incrementally increasing in speed
  - Increment method?
  - Max speed?
  - R&D Parallax
- A much slower steadily moving background
  - Different speeds?
  - Different worlds/levels?
  - Night/day?
  - Weather/Environment changes?
- A jumping sprite--our one and only, Super Isa
  - Simple jump physics--for now
  - Rainbow laser?
  - Health Meter?
  - Other characters?
- Other sprites--enemies/obstacles to jump over/defeat
  - Same pace as moving platform?
  - Health meter for baddies?
  - Evil laser guns/strange weapons for some baddies?
  - Helpful NPCs?
- A Score/info window somewhere at the top of the screen.
  - Health
  - Character
  - World/level
  - Lives
  - *power ups?*
